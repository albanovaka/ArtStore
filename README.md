I have created a store mobile app in IOS in which you can add to basket, add to favorites, as well as checkout. 
I did this using FireStorage, Firebase and Stripe.
FireStorage in order to store everything that is in the Basket or the Favorite, as well as for checkout (Address info for the customer), it
is stored in the cloud in case the user decides to close the application.
Sign in is using Firebase in which you can either log in by registering or with google.
Stripe is used as the paiement method in this app.
